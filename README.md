# Programming-Design-Paradigm
A series of problems solved as a part of class CS5010: Programming Design Paradigm </br>
Programming languages used : DrRacket and Java </br>

CS 5010 is the introductory course for students in the MSCS program at the Northeastern University. The course has two distinct objectives.</br>
First, it ensured all MS students have developed basic skills in program design, from problem analysis to developing test suites, using several program design paradigms. </br>
Second, the course introduced us to programming as a people discipline. We presented code to review panels and learned to cope with an evolving code base.</br>
